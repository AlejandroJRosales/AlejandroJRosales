### Welcome ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alejandro Rosales

I am working on my Master of Science in Computer Science, with a research focus on quantum machine learning. I love learning new things and pursuing a deeper understanding of anything and everything. I also have a lot of fun problem-solving and being creative, so naturally, I enjoy optimizing and building new things; things generally, technology especially. Hence, why this repo is filled with personal projects! :)

I would be happy to collaborate on anything quantum computing-related!
